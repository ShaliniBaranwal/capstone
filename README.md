# Capstone

Capstone Project: Job Portal
Timings: 21/01/2023 - 29/01/2023

**Team - G4**: Suma &amp; Shalini 

We have tried to replicate [this job portal](https://www.figma.com/file/VhTa9EH1FxszIjiVr7xc8u/Jobs?node-id=0%3A1&t=0KMYGKyAgYIIRJwU-0).


# Job Portal

To run the project:
* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* Install [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org)

* Typing **`gem install rails`** installs Rails using **gem** (comes with ruby). Now Ruby on Rails is set up on your device.
* Now we have to install all the packages required to run the frontend. Open the folder in terminal using `cd frontend`. Now type `npm install` to install all the packages required to run the project.

* Now while executing the project:
    backend needs to be run on port 3001. __**`rails s -p 3001`**__ shall do the trick.
    frontend needs to be run on port 3000. __**`npm start`**__ will work.
